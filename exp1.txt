Here’s a clear and exam-friendly explanation you can say or print as your viva note. It keeps the technical meaning but flows naturally when spoken.

## **Explanation of the Flight Management System Code**

### **Aim**

To create a simple *Flight Management System* using **C++** that stores cities and the flights between them, and represents these connections using both an **Adjacency Matrix** and an **Adjacency List**.

---

### **Concept Used**

The program is based on the **Graph Data Structure**, where:

* **Nodes (Vertices)** represent *cities*
* **Edges** represent *flights* between cities
* **Weights** represent *costs* of those flights

Two common ways to represent a graph are used:

1. **Adjacency Matrix** – a 2D table showing flight cost between every pair of cities.
2. **Adjacency List** – a list form showing each city and the cities it’s connected to.

---

### **Header Files and Data Structures**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>
using namespace std;
```

* **iostream** – for input/output
* **vector** – to store dynamic lists and the matrix
* **map** – to assign each city a unique index number

**Private Members:**

```cpp
map<string, int> cityIndex;
vector<string> cities;
vector<vector<int>> matrix;
vector<vector<pair<int, int>>> list;
```

| Member      | Purpose                                             |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `cityIndex` | Stores city name → index mapping                    |
| `cities`    | Stores city names in order                          |
| `matrix`    | Stores flight cost between two cities               |
| `list`      | Stores city connections as pairs `(neighbor, cost)` |

---

### **Member Functions**

#### **1. addCity(string name)**

* Adds a new city to the system if it does not already exist.
* Updates:

  * `cityIndex` map
  * `cities` list
  * Resizes `matrix` and `list`
* Prints a confirmation message.
  **Example:**
  `City added: Pune`

---

#### **2. addFlight(string cityA, string cityB, int cost)**

* Finds indexes of both cities using `cityIndex`.
* Adds flight in **both directions** (bidirectional).
* Updates:

  * `matrix[a][b]` and `matrix[b][a]`
  * `list[a]` and `list[b]`
* Displays confirmation message.
  **Example:**
  `Flight added: Pune <-> Delhi (Cost: 500)`

---

#### **3. checkConnected(string cityA, string cityB)**

* Checks if a flight exists between two cities using the matrix.
* If cost > 0 → they are connected.
  **Output:**
  ✓ Connected! Cost: 500
  ✗ Not connected

---

#### **4. displayMatrix()**

* Prints the adjacency matrix in table form.
  **Example:**

```
Matrix:
0 500 0
500 0 200
0 200 0
```

---

#### **5. displayList()**

* Prints the adjacency list for each city.
  **Example:**

```
List:
Pune -> Delhi(500)
Delhi -> Pune(500) Mumbai(200)
Mumbai -> Delhi(200)
```

---

### **Main Function**

```cpp
int main() {
    FlightSystem flights;
    ...
}
```

* Creates an object `flights` of the `FlightSystem` class.

* Uses a **menu-driven loop** to perform actions:

  1. Add City
  2. Add Flight
  3. Check Connection
  4. Show Matrix
  5. Show List
  6. Exit

* The loop runs until the user chooses option 6.

---

### **Sample Output**

```
=== SIMPLE FLIGHT SYSTEM ===
1. Add City
2. Add Flight
3. Check Connection
4. Show Matrix
5. Show List
6. Exit

Choose: 1
City name: Pune
City added: Pune

Choose: 1
City name: Delhi
City added: Delhi

Choose: 2
City 1: Pune
City 2: Delhi
Cost: 500
Flight added: Pune <-> Delhi (Cost: 500)

Choose: 3
City 1: Pune
City 2: Delhi
✓ Connected! Cost: 500
```

---

### **Advantages**

* Demonstrates use of **graphs**, **maps**, and **vectors**.
* Uses both adjacency matrix and list — helps understand trade-offs.
* Menu-driven and easy to interact with.

### **Output Comparison**

| Representation       | Description                           | Example                       |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Adjacency Matrix** | Table showing cost between all cities | Fast lookup, uses more memory |
| **Adjacency List**   | Compact list of direct connections    | Saves memory, easier to read  |

---

### **Conclusion**

This program efficiently demonstrates the **graph representation** of a flight network using **C++ OOP concepts**, **STL containers** (`map`, `vector`), and provides both **Adjacency Matrix** and **Adjacency List** views.
It helps understand how graphs can model real-world systems like flight routes or city connections.
